HTML::BarGraph
--------------
A Perl module which creates bar graphics for one or more datasets, using plain
HTML and, optionally, "stretched" pixel images.

Features
--------
- it can display more than one data set on the same graphic
- one can change the direction of the bars (vertical, horizontal) by simply 
  changing one parameter
- when used in plain HTML mode, the graphic (and the module) is completely 
  independent - it doesn't require any graphic or graphic library
- when used in plain HTML mode, the graphic is entirely included in the page, so
  by saving the webpage, the whole graphic is saved with it
- highly customizable
- graphics for web polls and such simple data sets can be quickly created, 
  without the overhead implied by "on the fly" graphic generation


Screenshots ;)
--------------
A sample of what the module can do is included in the distribution (sample.html).
The source of this HTML file contains the parameters that each graph was generated
from.


Install
-------
HTML::BarGraph is plain Perl, and so far has no dependencies, so install it like:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install


Pixels
------
Before using the module with 'bartype' set to 'pixel', you need to install 
the various color pixels which will be used to draw the bars.  As a start, you 
can use the pixels provided in the module's distribution (pixels/*.png).  You 
need to install these manually, since there's no way to know the location where
you want them to live.


Enjoy.
